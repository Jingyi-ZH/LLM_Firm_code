Restrictions are derived from international laws or directives, regulatory agencies, eco‑label requirements, environmental standards, and Apple policies. Every Apple product is free of PVC and phthalates except for AC power cords in India, Thailand (for two‑prong AC power cords), and South Korea, where we continue to&nbsp;seek government approval for our PVC and phthalates replacement. Apple products comply with the European Union Directive 2011/65/EU and its amendments, including exemptions for the use of lead such as high-temperature solder. Apple is working to phase out the use of these exempted substances for new products where technically possible.</p></li></ol></div>
